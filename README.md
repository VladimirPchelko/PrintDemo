# Print Demo

Sample project that prints arabic text to ThermalReceipt printer. Main idea is to pre-renders text as Image to bypass RTL issues.

## Getting Started

For dev/test purposes used Virtual Printer, project is configured to use "Two Pilots Demo Printer" with "ThermalReceipt" page layout. "Two Pilots Demo Printer"  can be downloaded from: http://www.colorpilot.com/emfprinter_versions.html

And http://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/_arabic is used to generate text in Arabic.

Use -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 if the default text encoding is not UTF8.
